        <h1>Dick Melstrom</h1>
        <p>OMG. It is unbelievable that your father, my wonderful heartfelt friend for almost 50 years is about to be ...well I can not say his age because, well he still acts like a 16 year old, and that is the way I choose to think of him. Chronological age does not describe this man. In his heart and in his mind he is a very young man. O K, enough of this patronizing dribble. He, in reality, can be so annoying. There are too many times to mention and indeed remember that he has been so...annoying. And living two houses away was sometimes not far enough. Lending him a shovel and having it returned in two pieces (ran over it with his car). Loaning him a long extension cord and having it return in two pieces (ran over it with a lawn mower.) And then, I will never forget pulling his boat hoist out of Lake Cadillac in a snow storm(!), yes, it was snowing (where were you kids then?). My hands have never been so cold, and I still wonder why he waited so long to get around to it.</p>
<p>Oh, your father has a wonderful sense of humor, despite his annoyance. This is cute, although he and I were probable the only ones that thought this was cute. Our neighbor, Dr. Tatarchuk was having the monthly medical society meeting at his house. At that time in history, all medical doctors had &quot;pagers&quot; (no such thing as cell phones, O K, now you know how old both of us are). So Rick and I attached our garage door openers to our belt (like pages attached to the doctor's belt) and we walked in Dr. Tatarchuk's house and &quot;crashed&quot; the meeting. Rick and I thought that this was hysterical...but those serious men did not, which in retrospect makes it that much more entertaining. And this reminds me of another time that we crashed a dinner party. He insisted that I meet his new neighbors across the street in T.C. The neighbors and their guests were in the middle of their dinner when Rick insisted that we just walk in, and we did. Unlike those stuffy doctors back in Cadillac, Rick's new neighbors were charmed by our intrusion. And because of your father's charm, we were invited to stay. I am certain that I could go on and on about other ventures with you father, but his multiple friends have things to say also.</p>
<p>I want to conclude by saying that your father has added measurably to my life. His enthusiasm, intellect, humor, devotion, maturity, and immaturity make this man unique beyond comparison. I love you dad like a brother. When I see or hear from him, I just smile the whole time. He is (at the expense of being trite) like a wonderful bottle of French wine. The vintage is outstanding and he just keeps getting better with age. And so, despite our ages, we are not done living yet. I have been watching his most recent path, and I have been so flattered that he has shared this with me. He makes me feel special by this overture. But the special one is your father.</p>
<p>What a heart he has, and the world is a better place because of him.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday!</p>
