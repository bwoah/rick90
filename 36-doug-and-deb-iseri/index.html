        <h1>Doug and Deb Iseri</h1>
        <p>When checking off desirable features for house hunters; something that rarely makes the list is how prospective buyers might 'mesh' with their neighbors. Yes, I think everyone looks at the neighborhood; but there's a big difference between the feel and location of an area and the occupants. Well, one step into the house on State St in May of 2020, both Deb &amp; I knew this was the house for us, but through sheer dumb luck; we also hit the jackpot with our neighbors. Though Rick would agree (or better) agree that he is married to his better half; his dry wit, warm smile and willingness to help anywhere possible, make this a wonderful neighborhood, in all ways. </p>
<p>Happy Birthday Rick-Elite 80 has a nice ring to it!</p>
