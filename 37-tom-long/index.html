        <h1>Tom Long</h1>
        <p>Hey Rick....Happy birthday!! Hope you have a great day and many more..it's been a long time in life since you and I and Terry crawled up in that loft at your Lexington house . There are many great memories for me there spending time with you..Going over to the ice house across the street, catching perch 3 and 4 at a time off the pier, swimming and water skiing in that ice cold lake, but we were kids and did not know any better. </p>
<p>We are both 80 now, and somehow you always seemed a lot younger, but welcome to my world old fella. Miss you, and enjoy your day. Hope to see you sooner than later cousin.....</p>
<p>Tom Long</p>
