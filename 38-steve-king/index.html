        <h1>Steve King</h1>
        <p>Rick, I wanted to wish you the happiest of birthdays. You are always a joy to spend time with. You are an example of someone who has learned from your life experiences and shared those experiences with others so they may benefit from what you have learned. You have been a cherished friend. </p>
<p>Again, the happiest of birthdays to you and the family you are celebrating with! </p>
<p>Steve King</p>
