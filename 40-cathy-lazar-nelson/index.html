        <h1>Cathy Lazar Nelson</h1>
        <p>Cathy Nelson may not be a household name in the Fulmer household, but for 20 years, Rick Fulmer was a household name in mine! My kids grew up hearing his name – Rick this, Rick that. He was a huge part of my life as an employee of Watson/Swope and later, at the creative agency, Lindy Lazar. Along with incredible talents like George Watson and Joe McCarthy, Rick was an important mentor to me, and I am grateful for all the opportunities he gave me. </p>
<p>But truthfully, what stands out most to me about Rick is his fierce love for, and his utter pride in, his family. Rick can't talk about his kids without his face breaking open with a light that shines from within. He beams when he talks about Beth, Ty, Shaun, Annie, Brian, and, of course, Jane. It is in that way that I most admire you, Rick. You have been impactful in the most important role of all – that of being a father, and I'm sure you're an incredible grandpa, too. </p>
<p>Thank you for being my colleague and my friend. God bless you on your 80th!	</p>
