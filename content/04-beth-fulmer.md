Happy 80th, Dad! As one of five, I'm still not sure how you managed to survive all of usâ€”and still keep your sense of humor. Some of the best memories are from days on the boat and our Florida vacations. Hope your day is relaxing and that the year ahead is full of time to connect with family and friends. 

Beth
