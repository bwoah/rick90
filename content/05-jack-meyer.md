Dear Rick, 

Back in the mid 80's when my brother Tim and I were struggling to resurrect Caberfae Ski Area from bankruptcy, you stepped in and created a marketing plan that we used for the following five plus years! The theme was based on the fact that Caberfae was the oldest ski area in the state of Michigan (also the fourth oldest in the nation): Hence the slogan "Where it all began!" 

I will be forever indebted to you as your generosity and work product were essential in our success. 

Happy birthday and keep swinging! 

Jack
