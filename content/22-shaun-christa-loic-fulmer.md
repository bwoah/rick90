Happy 80th, Dad! 

What a special birthday to celebrate. I wanted you to know how grateful I am that you are my Dad and Grandpa to Loic. I really enjoy watching the two of you together and hearing him laugh. 

I had such a fun childhood filled with wonderful memories and I want to do the same for Loic. So think of that as a small part of your legacy on your 80th birthday. 

Love, Shaun
