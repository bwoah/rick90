### Memories with Rick 
It was challenging to choose just one memory of Rick Fulmer, as there are many experiences and escapades that come to mind. Here are just a few: 

### Rick, "The Courageous"
We were skiing in a challenging area near Lake Tahoe when we encountered a slope designated," Double Black Diamond." Rick, opting not to take the blue run, asked me to ski ahead and show him the way down. After skiing for about 30 yards, I turned to see Rick speed past me with a look of alarm on his face. He managed his way down the steep slope, through a field of moguls, and came to a safe stop at the bottom. At the bottom, with sweat dripping, he said, "Black Diamonds aren't that tough!" 

### Rick, "The Altruist"
Rick can be quite persuasive. After a full day of skiing, 10 of us arrived at a lodge for dinner. During dinner, Rick quietly went around to each person and without explanation he successfully collected $100 from each of us. He stuffed the money in his pocket, sat down, and said, "Just wait, you are going to love this." After dinner, our waitress approached us in the parking lot and gave each of us a hug of sincere gratitude. 

### Rick, "The Trickster" 
After golf, the topic of water skiing came up, and someone recalled that I used to ski barefoot. Rick immediately remarked that while he didn't doubt my past abilities, my waterskiing days were but a distant memory. Predictably, I rose to the bait and bet him $100 that I could still perform like a teenager. The bet was set to take place the next morning on Lake Cadillac, witnessed by Rick, Jeff Olsen, Steve Frisbie, and Phil Potvin. The results of that day on the water are shown below:

I love you, Rick. Happy 90th birthday. Regan
