Hey Rick....Happy birthday!! Hope you have a great day and many more..it's been a long time in life since you and I and Terry crawled up in that loft at your Lexington house . There are many great memories for me there spending time with you..Going over to the ice house across the street, catching perch 3 and 4 at a time off the pier, swimming and water skiing in that ice cold lake, but we were kids and did not know any better. 

We are both 80 now, and somehow you always seemed a lot younger, but welcome to my world old fella. Miss you, and enjoy your day. Hope to see you sooner than later cousin.....

Tom Long
