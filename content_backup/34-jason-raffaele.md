Happy 80th. Thank you for all the years of friendship, guidance, advice, support and being a sounding board. Seems like we have covered a lot of ground together. All the way back to working for you at Rubber and Plastics in about 1985. Interesting and great transition from helping me become gamefully employed to becoming family. Seems like that normally works the opposite way. 

I still remember showing Chris pictures from a ski trip, to which she stated, "That's my uncle Rick!"â€¦..probably our second date. That has been the start to a lot of "our life in Chicago" stories. I have enjoyed all the time we have spent together and the projects along the way.
